- `OK` indicating the API request was successful.
- `ZERO_RESULTS` indicating that the search was successful but returned no results. This may occur if the search was passed a bounds in a remote location.

  - You have exceeded the QPS limits.
  - Billing has not been enabled on your account.
  - The monthly $200 credit, or a self-imposed usage cap, has been exceeded.

  See the [Maps FAQ](https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#over-limit-key-error) for more information about how to resolve this error.
- `REQUEST_DENIED` indicating that your request was denied, generally because:
  - The request is missing an API key.
  - The `key` parameter is invalid.
- `UNKNOWN_ERROR` indicating an unknown error.
